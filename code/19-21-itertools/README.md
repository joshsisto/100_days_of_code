# Days 19-21: Itertools

Iteration is something you absolutely have to grasp in order to master Python. 

Itertools helps make iteration simpler and is incredibly powerful which is why you'll be learning it for the next 3 days! 


## Day N: Watch videos and Play in the Shell!

For your first day, watch all of the videos up until the traffic lights app.

After watching the first 4 videos pop into your Python shell and start playing around with `cycle()`, `product()`, `combinations()` and `permutations()`.


## Day N+1: Create a Traffic Lights script

Yep that's right! For your second day, use itertools to create a script that simulates traffic lights!

If you get absolutely stuck, watch the *Traffic Lights* video to see how we did it.


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

For your last day, I'm going to suggest you head to our [codechalleng.es](https://codechalleng.es) platform and take a few of the itertools themed Bites.

The following 3 links will get you free access to the Bites:

[Bite 64](https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/itertools-fun1)

[Bite 17](https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/itertools-fun2)

[Bite 65](https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/itertools-fun3)

You don't need to do them in any particular order, they're just there for you to learn something!
