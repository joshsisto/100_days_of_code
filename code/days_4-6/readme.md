# Get Pythonic with the collections module

## First day: your new data structure friends

The collections module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple. - docs

In this Day 1 lesson we will use the most common collections types showing some easy to follow examples. Day 2 we will get some more practice using them on a movie data set. Day 3 we have you further practice using your own data. I am using Python 3.6 for this notebook.

## Second day: practice using movie data

For Code Challenge 13 - Highest Rated Movie Directors we used a nice movie data set. Let's import it here to see some of our newly learned collections data types in action.

## Third day: more practice on your own data

We challenge you to find your own data set and try to use the new collections data structures yourself.
