# Days 07-09: Data Structures

Data Structures are *key* (pun intended) to mastering Python. In fact, they're so important, we're dedicating an entire 3 days to them!

Even if you're familiar with data structures, this will be a useful refresher.


## Day N: Watch videos and play around!

Watch all of the videos. They'll provide you with the foundation you need to get working with lists, tuples and dictionaries.

Have a play with your own lists, dicts and tuples in the Python shell and familiarise yourself with them.

Feel free to watch the *What we learned* video as well as a recap!


## Day N+1: PyBites CodeChalleng.es Bite

Click this link: [https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/datastructures](https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/datastructures)

This will take you to our CodeChalleng.es platform and unlock a Bite for free.

Follow the on page instructions once you've redeemed the Bite and see if you can solve the problem!


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

**UPDATE: We decided to wrap the below (and a little more) into a Bite on the CodeChalleng.es Platform for you. You're still more than welcome to perform the work as per the below but if you want to try this in a Bite then [click here](https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/listvsdict) to redeem the Bite for free.

Create a script that imports the US States data structures contained in the following script file in our Repo: [https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/07-09-data-structures/code/data.py](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/07-09-data-structures/code/data.py) 

Perform the following tasks on the list and dict. The less you look at them, the better this exercise will be. Remember: **Dicts are unsorted**.

- Print out the 10th item in each.

- Print out the 45th key in the dictionary.

- Print out the 27th value in the dictionary.
